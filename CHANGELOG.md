# Changelog

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-03-12

### Bug Fixes

- **Currency**: Fixed decimal precision issues with Turkish Lira formatting.
- **CVV**: Fixed input length restriction to correctly support 4 digits for Amex.
- **Alpha**: Resolved issues with space character handling.
- **Email**: Prevented validation errors from triggering immediately while typing.

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-02-24

### Improvements

- **Enhanced Card Validation**: `validateLuhn` now includes strict length checks based on card type.
  - **Amex**: Must be 15 digits (starts with 34/37).
  - **Others (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)**: Must be 16 digits.
  - This prevents mathematically valid but structurally invalid card numbers (e.g. 15-digit Visa numbers) from passing validation.
